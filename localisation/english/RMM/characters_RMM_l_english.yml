Since that day the two have settled into a tense but tolerable arrangement, Harper fighting at the Mooseketeers' side when the cause is suitably great or the situation understandably dire, but otherwise remaining free to maraud throughout the kingdom at will."

Realizing that they were probably members of a secret organization he had always dreamed of joining, he killed the group, cut out one of the corpses' faces and put it on himself like a mask.\n\nRoggy was proud of himself when he arrived at the secret Agent base, although he caught a lot of frightened looks, but his ingenious disguise had worked and not a single agent had said a word to him. Later they started to address him as Agent Gamma, and Roggy finally felt that he was part of something great."
  RMM_mike_ael_name:0 "Wing Haster"
  RMM_mike_ael_desc:0 "There were many among the Musketeers who were in one way or another wronged by and disliked the Royal Nobility, but even among these Wing Haster stood out. His hatred for Manitoba went beyond all imaginable limits, and he could spend hours on end spelling out all the reasons for his hatred of the kingdom. But his hatred was not limited to the Kingdom alone. For whatever reason, Metis was also within the realm of his hatred, the reason for which no one could understand. And sometimes he even said that he hated even us, Mooseketeers. Yet despite all of this Mike had a strange love for Langenburg. \n\nMcClane tried to understand the reason for all this strange hatred in Wing, but after being stuck for three hours listening to his non-stop jabbering he gave up and just left him to himself."



  RMM_MCCLANE_DESC:0 "§g"Give me freedom or give me death!"§!\n\nIf there were ever a single man to embody these words it would be McClane. He served with distinction in the Royal Navy and it would be during this time that he would develop his apparent resentment towards nobility. Constantly overlooked for promotion or given the most unenviable positions because of his family's rank as minor nobility it is easy to see why he would have switched sides once social conflict that had been boiling underneath the kingdom's surface finally erupted into war.\n\nHowever, simple disenfranchisement does not explain away the more radical viewpoints he has adopted for himself since, perhaps he had always held these uncompromising beliefs or perhaps it simply gave him an excuse to continue the fight against his former superiors. Either way after delivering the Republic at a decisive victory at Black Ridge McClane did not simply return to port to be hailed a hero and instead pushed deep into the enemy’s heartland, driving his men beyond the point of physical exhaustion before successfully capturing the key city of Dawfin and the Royal dockyards.\n\nInstead of hastening, what they believed to be the glorious victory of the Republic, McClane and his men suddenly found themselves confronted with the reality of peace. Enraged at this apparent compromise, this outright betrayal of the Republics libertarian ideals and the willing acceptance of the continued servitude of the remaining Kingdom, McClane refused the offer of the Traitor Republic to leave his positions to join them, and set up his own emergency government of the true republicans in exile.\n\nWhile he did not encourage his men to leave he did subsequently grant any who wished to return the right to leave his service, emphasizing the personal freedom of each and every individual was the only thing that lead and kept them by his side. A few, mainly the old, accepted the offer, but many stayed, inspired by revolutionary fervor, becoming the Mooseketeers and continuing the fight for what they believe to be true liberty.\n\n§Y"One for all and all for one!"§!"
