  nf_rmm.1.d:0 "A terrible insult came today from Senator McClain, in spite of all the aid and co-operation we offered for the struggle was rejected and our soldiers were demanded to be removed from the country. Two of our commanders-in-chief who organized the military tactics against Manitoba have already arrived in the capital.\n\nThe Senator declares that the Republic has betrayed the Revolution and only the Mooseketeers are the only worthy sucessors of it. Let's see how the Senator's rhetoric changes when Manitoba comes knocking on his door."
  nf_rmm.1.a:0 "Let the Kingdom deal with them then."

  nf_rmm.2.t:0 "The Revolution Is Not Yet Over"
  nf_rmm.2.d:0 "Senator McClain was in a state of extreme tension today, and anyone who was in the assembly hall with him could see it. But what the senator did not have in him was fear, he had a look of determination on his face in addition to tension.\n\n§2"Greetings ladies and gentlemen, do you remember how we came to be here? It's hard to forget. We, former members of the Manitoba Navy, rebelled against the tyranny of the kingdom, the tyranny of King Brandon I. And we won that battle! But that's the problem, we won that battle, but the war wiht Manitoba never stopped.\n\nI doubt anyone seriously thought Manitoba would leave us alone. Our enemies have weakened, but every day they are regaining their lost strength, looking for an opportunity to bring us under their wing, back into tyranny.\n\nThe enemy is strong. That cannot be denied. But neither can our resolve! We have already defeated the Kingdom, and when they attack, we will defeat them again. But don't forget the most important thing, we are not alone. The Republic of Three Rivers will help us in our battle for revolution.\n\nThe Republican dream will live on!"§!"

  nf_rmm.13.d:0 ""What do you think you're doing, Agent?"\n\nAgent Sigma knew that voice, anyone in Chicago had heard it.\n\nThe Secretary. And now he was angry.\n\n"You see Agent, you're easy to replace, but what you've done is going to be very difficult to undo. According to your orders, you were supposed to monitor the activities of the Manitoba area after your successful takedown of the CPF leadership and not take unnecessary initiative. But you disobeyed orders, Agent, and in doing so jeopardized our years of work to build a network of agents in Canada. Do you have something to say in your defence?"\n\nThe Agent felt a shiver go through his body. It's just an eyebot, not the Secretary personally, he shouldn't be afraid. But that wasn't helping him.\n\n"S-Secretary...I-I-I..."\n\n"You know what, Agent? I don't care what excuses you're going to make for yourself. You've brought the situation to this point and, therefore, don't even think about counting on help from Chicago."\n\n"If you do succeed in your venture, which I doubt, Chicago will come, but for now, you're on your own.""
  nf_rmm.13.a:0 ""I understand, Secretary.""

  nf_rmm.14.t:0 "Just As Planned"
  nf_rmm.14.d:0 ""Well, Agent S.L. you have pleasantly surprised me. No one expected you to succeed, but the result speaks for itself. Expect the Vertibirds. Like I said before, Chicago will come. Canada has a lot of things we can take, and we will take all of it."\n\nWith those words, an eyebot switched off.\n\nAgent Sigma felt as if he were ecstatic. Easily replaceable, huh? He had shown them all how irreplaceble he really is! And he's going to show them a lot more!\n\nManitoba was on fire, the sounds of Vertibirds tore through the air, explosive collars were put on the local population in droves, increasing the number of slaves and laborers. It's all thanks to him, Agent Sigma.\n\nSoon all of Manitoba, and eventually all of Canada, will be his playground, where he can do anyhting and everyone will do whatever he wants."

  nf_rmm.17.d:0 "§O"I can't die like this. I don't want to!"§!\n\nAgent Sigma barricaded himself in his office, the last safe place for him, and nervously clutched a plasma grenade in his hands as he listened to the angry people trying to get through his door. Agent Sigma was hard to recognise, his suit was covered in mud, his face full of abrasions and wounds, and he had lost his hat in the process of escaping.\n\nHow dare they leave him here, after all he'd done?! And worse, alone with these animals ready to tear him to pieces! But even a man like the Agent was quite principled, and was ready to take all his haters with him, filling the whole office with explosives and keeping a plasma grenade at the ready.\n\nThe Agent heard a loud thud. They had broken through. Agent Sigma pulled the cheque and ran with the grenade at them.\n\nAnd then there was silence."
