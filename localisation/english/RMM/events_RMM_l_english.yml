  nf_rmm.1.t:0 "Mooseketeers Reject Our Help!"
  nf_rmm.1.d:0 "A terrible insult came today from Chancellor McClane in spite of all the aid and co-operation we offered for the struggle was rejected and our soldiers were demanded to be removed from the country. Two of our commanders-in-chief who organized the military tactics against Manitoba have already arrived in the capital.\n\nThe Senator declares that the Republic has betrayed the Revolution and only the Mooseketeers are the only worthy sucessors of it. Let's see how the Senator's rhetoric changes when Manitoba comes knocking on his door."
  nf_rmm.1.a:0 "Let the Kingdom deal with them then."

  nf_rmm.2.t:0 "The Revolution Is Not Yet Over"
  nf_rmm.2.d:0 "Chancellor McClain nonchalant as always stepped up to the podium in the assembly hall and began his speech.\n\n§2"May I congratulate you, my dear Mooseketeers, on surviving another year together as we prepare for the inevitable war with Manitoba\n\nYou all remember how we ended up here in this beautiful town of Dawfin, which is now completely free of any nobility thanks to our efforts. How many lives were sacrificed to get here. And how you all followed me when I refused to evacuate, organising a republican government in exile here and for your faith in me I am grateful.\n\nWe also have guests and volunteers among us from the Three Rivers Republic, whom they generously provided to us despite my refusal to their evacuation offer. Appreciate it, although I have a few thoughts to say about their truce with Manitoba. However, saying such things in front of guests would be rude.\n\nSo! This year will be a challenging one, ladies and gentlemen, as the rotten kingdom licks its wounds and wants the Royal Dockyards back, and we stand in their way. We will not be broken, gentlemen! One for all and all for one!"§!"

  nf_rmm.4.t:0 "The Night of Plasma Rifle"
  nf_rmm.4.d:0 "As the saying goes, don't put all your eggs in one basket. The entire top brass of the Mooseketeers were in the assembly hall. But noone could've predicted that a thing like this would happen.\n\nAn explosion happened in the meeting room. But not just an ordinary explosion, the explosive cloud was colored green, and after the people affected by the explosion, there were only a handful of ashes. The survivors tried to run out of the assembly hall, but were met by people in black suits with plasma rifles in their hands.\n\n"Fire."\n\nAnd from the surviving leadership of the Mooseketeers just like that, all that was left was a handful of ashes on the floor.\n\nOne of the men at the head of the squad tucked his pistol behind his holster and pulled out a cigar. Taking a puff, he tossed the butt into the pile of ashes and took his walkie-talkie out of the pocket."
  nf_rmm.4.a:0 "§OInitiate Operation `Northern Wind`§!"

  nf_rmm.5.t:0 "The Glory of the Revolution"
  nf_rmm.5.d:0 "Vengeance Victorious!\n\nDespite all odds, they had succeeded, and the whole of Manitoba was on fire, warming McClane's heart. The Chancellor's first order of business was to place guillotines in every street to give the nobles what they deserved.\n\nBut this order was stopped by the Admiral's Council. Though they were eager to do the same, republican ideals must be respected. And the question of the fate of the nobles, as well as other questions of action in post-war Manitoba, must be put to all for discussion.\n\nIn keeping with his republican ideals, McClane believed that the nobles should be executed here and now, but still relented and convened a council to decide what next action the Mooseketeers would take with regard to defeated Manitoba."
  nf_rmm.5.a:0 "§2What a pointless endeavour.§!"

  nf_rmm.6.t:0 "The Fate of Nobles"
  nf_rmm.6.d:0 "And the first issue brought before the council was obviously the fate of the nobility of the kingdom. McClane's solution was quick and simple, round up all of Manitoba's nobles and send them to the guillotine. Yes, it would create a power vacuum in the country, but by not cutting out all the rot now, the Mooseketeers risked repeating the fate of the Kingdom.\n\nAdmiral Coral Hall, head of the Admiral's Council, was less radical. Yes, the nobles were worst of the worst, but even among them there were a few who had risen to noble status as simple commoners like William Tanner. There were also a few who, despite their status, had not been seduced by greed and power. The Admiral proposed to let them live, and to hold a "trial" for the rest, where there would be no corrective judgement"
  nf_rmm.6.a:0 "Behead bastards here and now."
  nf_rmm.6.b:0 "Give them a phantom chance."

  nf_rmm.7.t:0 "The Sack of Manitoba"
  nf_rmm.7.d:0 "The Mooseketeers remember our rebellion and all the pain and loss it brought. Now the hour of reckoning has come. But our soldiers have had the restraint not to act upon their wishes, they have asked the Chancellor for permission to loot the estates of the nobles and those associated with them.\n\nMcClane didn't care about the fate of the monarchists. They had chosen who to support, and now let them reap the rewards of their choice. Everyone had the option of fleeing to the Mooseketeers or the Republic. The Chancellor realized that innocent people might suffer in the process, but revolution was no stranger to collateral damage.\n\nAdmiral Coral Hall was in extreme disagreement with the Chancellor's opinion. In return, she proposed to first determine where all the nobles' estates were, seize all their property, and pay the soldiers' pensions out of it. Yes, it would take longer, but the Admiral did not want to allow the death of innocents."
  nf_rmm.7.a:0 "Why should we care about monarchy supporters?"
  nf_rmm.7.b:0 "Soldiers deserve a more morally right compensation."

  nf_rmm.8.t:0 "Establishing Our Rule"
  nf_rmm.8.d:0 "The last issue raised at the council was the organization of the government.\n\nCurrently, the basis of power was the Admiral's Council headed by Coral Hall, and Chancellor McClane headed the government. However, there was a new desire from the people to make beloved Iron Chancellor the sole representative of the government. The war with Manitoba was over, but there was still much to be done, and the people believed that McClain alone could lead the country to prosperity.\n\nThe voices of the people grew louder and louder and it was decided to hold a vote among the people whether the Iron Chancellor would take power in his fist, with which he would crush all the enemies of the republic, or whether the Mooseketeers would still remain a democracy, as their ideals had bequeathed."
  nf_rmm.8.a:0 "Iron Chancellor will lead us to greater victories!"
  nf_rmm.8.b:0 "Democracy, first and foremost."

  nf_rmm.9.t:0 "A Different Perspective"
  nf_rmm.9.d:0 ""I have another suggestion," came a firm female voice from the assembly hall.\n\nThe owner of the voice was Admiral Coral Hall, head of the Admiral's Council. And after her words, she stood up and walked toward the podium where McClane stood.\n\n"Forgive me Chancellor, but I consider it a suicide for us to stay in Dawfin. I have faith in our soldiers, but faith must not be blind, we have little chance of standing against the Kingdom's army.\n\nInstead, I would like to propose that we take an adventure. We have one of the largest fleets in Canada and it's a sin not to take advantage of it.  You know about the raiders across the lake, don't you? We'll fill our ships to the brim with men and supplies and attack them, leaving Dawfin in the hands of the Kingdom.Many may not like it, but the success of our venture will give us the opportunity to join forces with our ally, the Three Rivers Republic, and together we will crush the kingdom and take our Dawfin back.\n\nSo, who's with me, Mooseketeers?""
  nf_rmm.9.a:0 "We'll follow the mother of the sea even into hell."

  nf_rmm.13.d:0 ""What do you think you're doing, Agent?"\n\nAgent Sigma knew that voice, anyone in Chicago had heard it.\n\nThe Secretary. And now he was angry.\n\n"You see Agent, you're easy to replace, but what you've done is going to be very difficult to undo. According to your orders, you were supposed to monitor the activities of the Manitoba area after your successful takedown of the CPF leadership and not take unnecessary initiative. But you disobeyed orders, Agent, and in doing so jeopardized our years of work to build a network of agents in Canada. Do you have something to say in your defence?"\n\nThe Agent felt a shiver go through his body. It's just an eyebot, not the Secretary personally, he shouldn't be afraid. But that wasn't helping him.\n\n"S-Secretary...I-I-I..."\n\n"You know what, Agent? I don't care what excuses you're going to make for yourself. You've brought the situation to this point and, therefore, don't even think about counting on help from Chicago."\n\n"If you do succeed in your venture, which I doubt, Chicago will come, but for now, you're on your own.""
  nf_rmm.13.a:0 ""I understand, Secretary.""

  nf_rmm.14.t:0 "Just As Planned"
  nf_rmm.14.d:0 ""Well, Agent S.L. you have pleasantly surprised me. No one expected you to succeed, but the result speaks for itself. Expect the Vertibirds. Like I said before, Chicago will come. Canada has a lot of things we can take, and we will take all of it."\n\nWith those words, an eyebot switched off.\n\nAgent Sigma felt as if he were ecstatic. Easily replaceable, huh? He had shown them all how irreplaceble he really is! And he's going to show them a lot more!\n\nManitoba was on fire, the sounds of Vertibirds tore through the air, explosive collars were put on the local population in droves, increasing the number of slaves and laborers. It's all thanks to him, Agent Sigma.\n\nSoon all of Manitoba, and eventually all of Canada, will be his playground, where he can do anyhting and everyone will do whatever he wants."

  nf_rmm.16.t:0 "Beggining of the End"
  nf_rmm.16.d:0 "Agent Sigma couldn't believe his eyes, but he couldn't deny the reality of what was happening.\n\nHe saw the Chicago soldiers loading equipment, weapons, and supplies onto rotorcrafts for shipment back to Chicago. A couple of those Helicopters had already flown over his head and ripped his hat off his head, but he was too stunned to pick it up off the ground.\n\nHe heard the Secretary's voice in the distance and rushed toward him. The Secretary was giving instructions to the soldiers loading the slaves aboard, there was very little room for them, but he insisted that as many as possible should be loaded for Chicago.\n\n"What do you mean there is no space? We should’ve had more free space after the old and sick were shot! What a shame, what-well, let us then sift out also some-"\n\n"Mr. Secretary!" a panting Agent Sigma came running up, "I made a terrible mistake, but please, I failed to send you resources just once, it doesn't mean the operation should be scrapped!".\n\nThe Agent couldn't see the expression on the Secretary's face through the Eyebot, but he thought as he was being looked at with contempt."

Agent Sigma was hard to recognise, his suit was covered in mud, his face full of abrasions and wounds, and he had lost his hat in the process of escaping.\n\nHow dare they leave him here, after all he'd done?! And worse, alone with these animals ready to tear him to pieces! But even a man like the Agent was quite principled, and was ready to take all his haters with him, filling the whole office with explosives and keeping a plasma grenade at the ready.\n\nThe Agent heard a loud thud. They had broken through. Agent Sigma pulled the cheque and ran with the grenade at them.\n\nAnd then there was silence."

  nf_rmm.22.d:0 "The position of Vice Admiral had always been considered a cushy position for nobles without talent, which you could give to anyone. But then McClane became the next Vice Admiral, he had served in the navy for many years and had always criticized its deplorable state and now at last he had the opportunity to sort things out himself.\n\nIn the short period of his appointment, he began to propose numerous reforms, only a few of which were able to pass through the nobility, who were constantly putting him in the wheels. Still, those reforms that were able to pass made a noticeable improvement in the state of the fleet, and new recruits wished to join it when they heard that a competent man was finally at the helm.\n\nBut at one point more and more of McClane's proposed reforms were blocked by the nobility, and his dislike of the nobility, which he had acquired through years of being constantly ignored for promotion and appointed to the most unenviable positions because his family belonged to the petty nobility, only continued to grow."

  nf_rmm.23.d:0 "It's easy to see why he switched sides as soon as the social conflict simmering beneath the kingdom's soil finally erupted into war. However, simple disenfranchisement does not explain away the more radical viewpoints he has adopted for himself since, perhaps he had always held these uncompromising beliefs or perhaps it simply gave him an excuse to continue the fight against his former superiors. \n\nWhen McClane heard of the rebellion in Winnipeg, he saw it as his chance to end the hated nobility once and for all. He called on his men to fight, and they all agreed, being loyalty not to the kingdom, but to McClane himself. And gathering his army, the "Mooseketeers" went into battle.\n\nAfter delivering the Republic at a decisive victory at Black Ridge, McClane did not simply return to port to be hailed a hero and instead pushed deep into the enemy’s heartland, driving his men beyond the point of physical exhaustion before successfully capturing the key city of Dawfin and the Royal dockyards.\n\nInstead of hastening, what they believed to be the glorious victory of the Republic, McClane and his men suddenly found themselves confronted with the reality of peace."

  nf_rmm.24.t:0 ""Mooseketeers""
  nf_rmm.24.d:0 "Enraged at this apparent compromise, this outright betrayal of the Republics libertarian ideals and the willing acceptance of the continued servitude of the remaining Kingdom, McClane refused the offer of the Traitor Republic to leave his positions to join them, and set up his own emergency government of the true republicans in exile.\n\nWhile he did not encourage his men to leave he did subsequently grant any who wished to return the right to leave his service, emphasizing the personal freedom of each and every individual was the only thing that lead and kept them by his side. A few, mainly the old, accepted the offer, but many stayed, inspired by revolutionary fervor, becoming the Mooseketeers and continuing the fight for what they believe to be true liberty."
