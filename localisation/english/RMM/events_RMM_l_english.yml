  nf_rmm.1.d:0 "A terrible insult came today from Chancellor McClane in spite of all the aid and co-operation we offered for the struggle was rejected and our soldiers were demanded to be removed from the country. Two of our commanders-in-chief who organized the military tactics against Manitoba have already arrived in the capital.\n\nThe Senator declares that the Republic has betrayed the Revolution and only the Mooseketeers are the only worthy sucessors of it. Let's see how the Senator's rhetoric changes when Manitoba comes knocking on his door."

  nf_rmm.2.d:0 "Chancellor McClain nonchalant as always stepped up to the podium in the assembly hall and began his speech.\n\n§2"May I congratulate you, my dear Moosketeers, on surviving another year together as we prepare for the inevitable war with Manitoba\n\nYou all remember how we ended up here in this beautiful town of Dawfin, which is now completely free of any nobility thanks to our efforts. How many lives were sacrificed to get here. And how you all followed me when I refused to evacuate, organising a republican government in exile here and for your faith in me I am grateful.\n\nWe also have guests and volunteers among us from the Three Rivers Republic, whom they generously provided to us despite my refusal to their evacuation offer. Appreciate it, although I have a few thoughts to say about their truce with Manitoba. However, saying such things in front of guests would be rude.\n\nSo! This year will be a challenging one, ladies and gentlemen, as the rotten kingdom licks its wounds and wants the Royal Dockyards back, and we stand in their way. We will not be broken, gentlemen! One for all and all for one!"§!"

  nf_rmm.13.d:0 ""What do you think you're doing, Agent?"\n\nAgent Sigma knew that voice, anyone in Chicago had heard it.\n\nThe Secretary. And now he was angry.\n\n"You see Agent, you're easy to replace, but what you've done is going to be very difficult to undo. According to your orders, you were supposed to monitor the activities of the Manitoba area after your successful takedown of the CPF leadership and not take unnecessary initiative. But you disobeyed orders, Agent, and in doing so jeopardized our years of work to build a network of agents in Canada. Do you have something to say in your defence?"\n\nThe Agent felt a shiver go through his body. It's just an eyebot, not the Secretary personally, he shouldn't be afraid. But that wasn't helping him.\n\n"S-Secretary...I-I-I..."\n\n"You know what, Agent? I don't care what excuses you're going to make for yourself. You've brought the situation to this point and, therefore, don't even think about counting on help from Chicago."\n\n"If you do succeed in your venture, which I doubt, Chicago will come, but for now, you're on your own.""
  nf_rmm.13.a:0 ""I understand, Secretary.""

  nf_rmm.14.t:0 "Just As Planned"
  nf_rmm.14.d:0 ""Well, Agent S.L. you have pleasantly surprised me. No one expected you to succeed, but the result speaks for itself. Expect the Vertibirds. Like I said before, Chicago will come. Canada has a lot of things we can take, and we will take all of it."\n\nWith those words, an eyebot switched off.\n\nAgent Sigma felt as if he were ecstatic. Easily replaceable, huh? He had shown them all how irreplaceble he really is! And he's going to show them a lot more!\n\nManitoba was on fire, the sounds of Vertibirds tore through the air, explosive collars were put on the local population in droves, increasing the number of slaves and laborers. It's all thanks to him, Agent Sigma.\n\nSoon all of Manitoba, and eventually all of Canada, will be his playground, where he can do anyhting and everyone will do whatever he wants."

Agent Sigma was hard to recognise, his suit was covered in mud, his face full of abrasions and wounds, and he had lost his hat in the process of escaping.\n\nHow dare they leave him here, after all he'd done?! And worse, alone with these animals ready to tear him to pieces! But even a man like the Agent was quite principled, and was ready to take all his haters with him, filling the whole office with explosives and keeping a plasma grenade at the ready.\n\nThe Agent heard a loud thud. They had broken through. Agent Sigma pulled the cheque and ran with the grenade at them.\n\nAnd then there was silence."

  nf_rmm.22.d:0 "The position of Vice Admiral had always been considered a cushy position for nobles without talent, which you could give to anyone. But then McClane became the next Vice Admiral, he had served in the navy for many years and had always criticized its deplorable state and now at last he had the opportunity to sort things out himself.\n\nIn the short period of his appointment, he began to propose numerous reforms, only a few of which were able to pass through the nobility, who were constantly putting him in the wheels. Still, those reforms that were able to pass made a noticeable improvement in the state of the fleet, and new recruits wished to join it when they heard that a competent man was finally at the helm.\n\nBut at one point more and more of McClane's proposed reforms were blocked by the nobility, and his dislike of the nobility, which he had acquired through years of being constantly ignored for promotion and appointed to the most unenviable positions because his family belonged to the petty nobility, only continued to grow."
  nf_rmm.22.a:0 "And then McClane made his choice."

  nf_rmm.23.t:0 "McClane and His Army"
  nf_rmm.23.d:0 "It's easy to see why he switched sides as soon as the social conflict simmering beneath the kingdom's soil finally erupted into war. However, simple disenfranchisement does not explain away the more radical viewpoints he has adopted for himself since, perhaps he had always held these uncompromising beliefs or perhaps it simply gave him an excuse to continue the fight against his former superiors. \n\nWhen McClane heard of the rebellion in Winnipeg, he saw it as his chance to end the hated nobility once and for all. He called on his men to fight, and they all agreed, being loyalty not to the kingdom, but to McClane himself. And gathering his army, the "Moosketeers" went into battle.\n\nAfter delivering the Republic at a decisive victory at Black Ridge, McClane did not simply return to port to be hailed a hero and instead pushed deep into the enemy’s heartland, driving his men beyond the point of physical exhaustion before successfully capturing the key city of Dawfin and the Royal dockyards.\n\nInstead of hastening, what they believed to be the glorious victory of the Republic, McClane and his men suddenly found themselves confronted with the reality of peace."
  nf_rmm.23.a:0 ""Peace? But all nobles are still alive!""

  nf_rmm.24.t:0 ""Mooseketeers""
  nf_rmm.24.d:0 "Enraged at this apparent compromise, this outright betrayal of the Republics libertarian ideals and the willing acceptance of the continued servitude of the remaining Kingdom, McClane refused the offer of the Traitor Republic to leave his positions to join them, and set up his own emergency government of the true republicans in exile.\n\nWhile he did not encourage his men to leave he did subsequently grant any who wished to return the right to leave his service, emphasizing the personal freedom of each and every individual was the only thing that lead and kept them by his side. A few, mainly the old, accepted the offer, but many stayed, inspired by revolutionary fervor, becoming the Mooseketeers and continuing the fight for what they believe to be true liberty."
