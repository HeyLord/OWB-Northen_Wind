  nf_mtc.1.d:0 "The Dakota military installation proved to be a primary target for Chinese bombs, with the opening barrage annihilating much of the facility and the surrounding area. The devastation wrought upon the land drove the survivors to flee across the no longer existing border into the Canadian occupation zone. It is here where the refugees would meet and eventually merge with the local population. There was much animosity and suspicion in the beginning, but overtime the need for cooperative survival overruled any previously held grudges leading to the formation of the institution that would soon become known as the Mettis Congress.   \n\nOver time this formation grew to encompass groups from different walks of life, scientists, robotic experts, security forces, farmers, miners, architects, all previously a part of the ruthless exploitation of canadian ressources now working together, contributing to a larger whole. Naturally their success wasn’t without obstacles and in time their thriving community grew to draw the attention of a never ending array of bandits and raiders seeking to benefit from Congress’s fortune by ill gotten means. Many of their early successes would be swept away in the coming conflicts and by its end a sizable portion of its population would end up kidnapped, enslaved or worse. In an act of desperation the people turned towards the last resort available to them, using their knowledge in robotics they repurposed the civilian and industrial robots towards a purpose of war and under the leadership of the first Machine General they fell upon their tormentors with hatred and steel. The name of the individual that carried them to victory is still remembered in the halls of the Mettis Congress..."

  nf_mtc.2.d:0 "In the end it wasn’t automated machines that brought peace to Mettis but a man as exceptional as he was unique, King Gunn. Through his exceptional leadership he managed to bring the people of the north together under one banner, exterminate much of the raider population and at last bring stability back to a region long devastated by conflict. While Mettis never adopted his strange practice of hereditary rule which was prevalent in his own domain, the people nonetheless willingly joined his Kingdom, seeing it as the brightest path towards a unified future. That was until he mysteriously disappeared, while everything pointed towards one of the kingdom's overly ambitious nobles being behind it, especially after no official investigation was launched. The king left no heirs but instead of gathering everyone of rank to vote on the successor the council of Manitoba appointed the kings lifelong advisor, a walking carcass who to add insult to injury took the king's name for his very own. Mettis seeing as the kingdom no longer held its interest in mind cut ties with the illegitimate regency in Manitoba, instead of accepting this, the corpse king and his council promptly declared Mettis traitors to the kingdoms despite lacking any form of legal jurisdiction. The resulting turmoil inflicted vast damage on to both sides and Mettis still suffers from its after effects in the field of..."

  nf_mtc.3.d:0 "It quickly became clear that conflict between the two sides was inevitable and so acting Machine General Tobias Thorns readied the automated forces of Metis for war with the usurper. The conflict would see  Manitoba’s forces split between the western and eastern front, with Mettis Congress and the freedom loving people of Three Rivers coming together to form the first coalition. Encouraged by early victories against the retreating royal forces Thorns ordered his divisions in pursuit, penetrating deep into Langenburg, which once taken would allow for the perfect pincer movement upon the capitol, decapitating the snake. However one man stood between Mettis and its ambition, the lord of Langenburg himself. Setting up his camp in scouting range of our eyebots he managed to successfully lure our forces forward expecting a pitched battle, however this was a ruse for Langenburg had successfully identified a key weakness in our mechanized force, their operators. Springing his ambush he successfully managed to outmaneuver our troops and strike at the fleshy core of what should have been an impenetrable chassis of forged steel. Our armies were decimated that day, our plans of invasion crushed and all that managed to escape were...."

  nf_mtc.8.d:0 "We've recently been visited by an absolutely wonderous sight, a flying city! It insists on being called a circus, but the wonderous technologies shown here deserve to be used for everyday life, not for showmanship and shameless parading. Some have expressed this exact suspicion and used it to detract the idea of us accepting the flying city visiting, but they were quickly shot down. And what a sight it was!\nThe fashions of the city were not made from gold or gilded metals, but rather brass and steel, shown being forged in steam-mills. People got around not through simple walking, but by being carried on steam-powered driverless carriages, though steam-horses were also on for show. Even the act of flying through the air was no longer limited to humongous craft, but could be accomplished through metal balloons and back-mounted packs that utilized superheated air to soar through the air!\nIt certainly has put a dent in the wallets of the citizens, as well as our own government, but the promise of this being the world of tomorrow certainly gives prospects of peace and prosperity to all, and is a welcome far cry from the war-ravaged world of today. It's only a shame we don't know who this circus came from..."
