  #WHC_PATRICIA_DESC:0 "While the king of Whitecourt, George Ramsey I, is out of the kingdom doing a political mission in the Kingdom of Manitoba, his heir, Princess Patricia, is leading the nation.\n\nMaybe she is inexperienced in handling the court, yet nobody takes her as a frivolous frisky. Taking adventures in the realm, she helped her subjects, pacified raiders and battled many wasteland creatures, making herself quite a reputation. Being brave but hotheaded and being kind but naive makes one good company, but not necessarily a good leader.\n\nThe question is, could she keep Whitecourt together until daddy comes home, or will she have to face some unexpected events that will be her, and her home, ultimate downfall?"
