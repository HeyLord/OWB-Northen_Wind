  nf_whc.1.t:0 "A Grave Warning"
  nf_whc.1.d:0 "The King of Communism, a name bestowed upon him by his loyal followers, as well as a name first given to him in a dream, awoke with a start. He had another one. And this one may be the last before the world, as tumultous as it had been for the past decade and a half, would come to an end.\nHe foresaw mushroom clouds of fire, men becoming beasts, a snowfall, unlike any before, engulfing much of Canada, and most intriguing of all, the iconic flag of Canada being burned away, being replaced by a flurry of symbols: A pink flower, a white flower, a yellow star, a cross, all of these and more, until the world seemingly burned away in a series of what could only be described as television static.\n\nThe King had been preparing for this. In secret, though he despised the capitalist's ideals, he had sought about constructing a series of underground shelters, similar to the pig's own 'Vaults'. But these were not to be the money grubbed shelters for fattened wage slaves to grow ever fatter in, no, these were the People's Bunkers. Made by the glorious labors of communal service for the state.\nBut the dream had foretold the King about that as well. In glimpses the King recognized as taking place in these Bunkers, he came to realize an important detail. One part of the dream showed his glorious People's Army, stationed in the bunker, growing ever stronger, but also more militant. Another part showed him his People, the common man whom which he had spent most of his life seeking to serve and bring the glory of Communism to. But neither of these dreams showed them intersecting. In fact, they showed them only growing further apart.\n\nAfter only seeing nothing but an empty black void, the King's mind cleared into a field of symbols and a red and yellow expanse. He found himself in even more of a literal field, of various crops that Canada had grown, even if only to sate the American's growing appetites, while the loyal People of Canada found themselves ever thinning. Alongside these, a small pile of valuables, gold, silver, diamonds, and other minerals and materials laid across the field.\n\nThe crops, however, became different, as the mushroom clouds returned. Corn became corse and hollow. Potatoes and tomatoes fused into an unholy combination. Apples became tumorous and berry-like. Cabbage grew to the size of melons, while grain became sharp and menacing. The valuables also dwindled and grew in size, devouring the smaller crops, while shredding the bigger crops into inedible rots."

  nf_whc.2.t:0 "Life is Not Better Above Ground"
  nf_whc.2.d:0 "After what seemed like years, perhaps decades, of living in the People's Bunker, the King grew old, passing on his wisdom and ideologies to the people of White Court. Whichever decision he had made, he was sure it was to have been the right one. After many, many years of watching what was once a clean and pristine Bunker turn into a rusted and aged living space, however, the People decided that it was finally time to open the doors.\nAnd so they did, entering a new world. But not one of the prophecies the King had been so passionate to visualize, ruled by a King or Queen or even a royalty, nor anything that remotely resembled the ideas of communism that they had spent so long perfecting in their secluded space.\n\nInstead, they were met with foul perversions of the world they should have been met with. Cold, harsh winters, isolated and antagonistic communities, even the flag of the capitalists still flew high above a neighboring area, proclaiming itself as the 'last bastion of American freedom'.\n\nTheir troubles were slightly lessened on facing this brave new, non-communist, world when, upon further inspection of their bunker, they realized..."
  nf_whc.2.a:0 "...That the King had spared no expense on safeguarding them."
  nf_whc.2.b:0 "...The blueprints of their Bunker had survived, albeit tattered and worn."

  nf_whc.3.t:0 "Enemies On All Sides"
  nf_whc.3.d:0 "Although the original King was no longer there to guide them, the new Monarch of White Court would ensure that their people would survive. There was only one reasonable explanation, learned by the Monarch and many of the Whitecourtians in their decades of living underground. Parallel dimensions exist, and they are not friendly.\n\nThe so-called 'CPF'? Failed communists from another dimension, clearly tained by capitalism and the greed that had driven many other socialist nations to ruin, with their only option being the Whitecourt dimension. That big shop called "Middlemark" the south? Capitalists who had driven their dimension to ruin with their greed and ever-fattening natures, come to rob the Whitecourts of all they had. The monster men of the 'Pioneer Company'? Americans who had been defeated by superior communists in their original dimension, having retreated to the Whitecourt dimension to escape being crushed by the glorious boot of socialism.\n\nThe People of White Court found this to be a completely reasonable explanation, although few of them truly understood quantum mechanics enough to question it, and didn't suspect that the idea of parallel dimensions may simply be the result of the many entertainment books and pseudoscience dime novels.\n\nBut the Monarch still needed to do something about the interlopers, interdimensional or not. In the end, they decided to..."
  nf_whc.3.a:0 "Be pragmatic. Fortify our border against the biggest possible threat!"
  nf_whc.3.b:0 "Be cautious. Fortify absolutely all of our borders! Not a single enemy must pass!"
  nf_whc.3.c:0 "Be aggressive. The insectoids are our enemy, the others can come later."
  nf_whc.3.e:0 "Be peaceful. Perhaps a bout of fishing may clear the mind."

  nf_whc.4.t:0 "Monarch To Monarch"
  nf_whc.4.d:0 "Whitecourt may not have had many friends in this new world, but they hoped that, after months of sending out scouts across the immediate region, the Kingdom of Manitoba, who seemed to be the only truly communist idealist that the King of Communism had prophecized about, would bring them respite, although they couldn't understand the reasoning of what happened in their dimension that they had come to this dimension.\nThe immediate response from Gunn, although he was certainly intrigued at the prospect of another monarchy in Canada, was that of annoyance and near-instant regret at their mannerisms. As the people of Whitecourt, the Monarch especially, had never truly encountered ghouls, their first belief upon seeing that Gunn was a Ghoul was that he simply must be Chinese, having ascended beyond his mortal coil of humanity, and been bestowed a new life by communism.\n\nTheir first conversation, however, did not do favors to either side.\nThe Monarch spoke first, speaking in his best recollection of Chinese. ("Greets, how you do today?")\n\nGunn II, although not expecting the language, or how badly it had been butchered, was thankful he had been a diplomat for so long, having retained much of his foreign language, and hoped that, by speaking it properly, he would be able to redeem the butchering that Whitecourt had done to it. ("I am doing well, thank you. What is the nature of the offer you intend to make?")\n\n("Me am helping need. Invaders beyond from dimensions bad.")\n\n("...Yes, I see. So you need the Kingdom of Manitoba's assistance against these... invaders?")\n\n("Certainting.")\n\nGunn II sighed. It would be a long time before the Whitecourt would even have the remote chance of speaking the refined Mandarin in a manner worth praising. Nevertheless, he nodded."

  nf_whc.8.d:0 "Prince Frank walked through the main building of Middlemark with disgust, though he was a man of science, the capitalist-soaked environment was close to breaking his appetite for knowledge. And so after a long search, something that could catch his attention finally appeared before the Prince.\n\nPrince Frank saw a gold-colored terminal that had gone out, and hoping that it was working, he began his attempts to turn it on. And to the Prince's delight, after all the unsuccessful attempts, the terminal decided to turn on. The mascot of the place appeared on the screen and a voice came out of the terminal.\n\n"Greetings dear customer! My name is Penny and on behalf of the company..."\n\n"Begone capitalist demon; you will not seduce me with your devilish speeches!"\n\nPenny looked at Frank through the screen and he thought he saw irritation in her eyes, but the Prince didn't care about the feelings of a capitalist.\n\n"Are you looking for something dear customer? Despite the devastation, which you have absolutely nothing to do with, we still have some goods that may interest you."\n\nThe Prince wanted to shut the machine up again, but what she was talking about might prove useful.\n\n"I give you permission to proceed."\n\n"Your permission is very important to us, dear customer. I would like to present three products to you, however due to the many destructions, which I repeat, you had nothing to do with, only one of them will be available to you."\n\nAnd so the three options popped up on the screen in front of the Prince."

  nf_whc.9.t:0 "A Royal Celebration"
  nf_whc.9.d:0 "As unexpected as the former CPF anticipated, Whitecourt was taking no precaution in celebrating their victory over the other foul interdimensional invaders. Food stores were opened, as both the royal family, from Monarch George Ramsey I, to Frank and Patricia Kang, and the common folk of the White Court, partook in the greatest feast of a lifetime.\n\nSingle portions of breakfast became double or triple, the Whitecourt Wineries were pushed to overtime to produce aged vintage wines, and, taking after their predecessors in communism long ago, portraits, busts, and statues were commissioned by the government to commemorate the people's victory over the infidels.\n\nWhile the celebrations occurred, a most peculiar event went on in the background. Over the course of the celebration day, which became a week, and was even predicted to last the month, reports from the newly captured territories indicated that the leaders of the former CPF were nowhere to be found. This coincided with Monarch Ramsey I obtaining strange meats during his meals. The largest oddity of which being a piece of flesh shaped in the form of a human brain. Although Ramsey I claimed it was simply an American delicacy known as brain fungus, even the Royal Kangs could not shake the feeling that the Monarch was indulging himself too much."
  nf_whc.9.a:0 "Nevertheless, victory was sweet, though the taste of flesh was bitter."

  nf_whc.10.t:0 "Even Monarchs Lose Their Wings"
  nf_whc.10.d:0 "King Gunn II sat in his personal study, preparing for yet another grueling conversation in Chinese. Though the Monarch had slightly improved in his communication, he was far from the refined and eloquent speech that he had once recalled having with Chinese operatives who made themselves home in the Manitoban Embassy.\n\nA knock at the door took Gunn away from his reminiscing. "Your Highness? It's Josephine."\n"Yes, come in, come in."\n\nThe door opened, revealing the Manitoban Royal Doctor, who had ensured the health of not only the Manitoban Royals, but also much of the health of the people. Her nimble, mouse-like form approached, her head hung low.\nGunn was apprehensive, he hoped that she had not come to tell him what he had feared for many decades. "Doctor, what troubles you? It's not my condition, is it?"\nJosephine shook, though she continued to refuse eye contact. "It's not that, your Highness. It's about the Whitecourt Monarch, Ramsey I. He was travelling through Brandon today, and... collapsed. I was called to the scene immediately. I've not come across it often, but I did my best to save him, but it wasn't enough."\n\nGunn's eyelids grew heavy, as he himself lowered his head. "I see. How did it happen? Poison? Assassination?"\n\n"No, your Highness. From my quick autopsy and a coroner report, it seemed that Monarch Ramsey had ingested large quantities of... human flesh, which resulted in the development of a particularly debilitating disease. It's certainly frowned upon, but I hate to admit that even in our own Kingdom, some partake in the practice, though they are found out and punished. My only fear is that you may have ingested it alongside him, have you partaken in any meals with strange meats?"\n\nThe King of Manitoba stood up from his desk, carefully placing his hand on Josephine's shoulder. "Doctor, I can assure you that I have done no such thing. But before you go, fetch me a pen and paper.""
  nf_whc.10.a:0 ""The people of Whitecourt need to hear of this, before anything worse happens.""

  nf_whc.11.t:0 "Migration of the Monarch"
  nf_whc.11.d:0 "The White Court was in an uproar. Over the past few hours since receiving the notice of condolences and funeral offering from Manitoba, the news was being taken in what could only be called a dysfunctional mess. Although the chain of succession indicated that either the Prince or Princess Kang was to take over, the main issue with the King of Communism's death was how he had died.\n\nThe White Court had known of the peculiarities of the King's recent dietary habits, but attributed it to a Pre-War superstition that eating the flesh of your most powerful enemies made you gain their powers or knowledge. Yet, while in Manitoba, the King had no means of supplying himself with the flesh of his enemies, nor would it have been appropriate for the Monarch to have eaten the flesh of his weakest foes.\n\nThis led the White Court to the belief that the King had passed on from human flesh deficiency. While the practice of cannibalism was certainly not unknown, the flesh of those from other dimensions may have caused issue with the White Court's primary dimensional digestion system. Which led to the current debate within the Court on how human flesh should be consumed, if it should be consumed at all.\n\nThe Kangs, however, had no such time to pay attention to the nonsense occurring in the chambers of the Court. It was time for one of them to take their father's place."

  nf_whc.13.d:0 ""It's beautiful," Prince Kang thought to himself. The spectacle of the Scarlet Casket stood out to him, even among all of the sights he had come to expect throughout his travels through these interdimensional visitors. Red, black, yellow, and white wires entangled themselves across the facility, as Robobrains churned out the front doors like bullets on a conveyor belt. The King of Communism had wished to arrange a meeting with RELCOM, being the most likely candidate to understand the unintentional space-time transport they had seemingly undergone, as well as hopefully being willing to help Whitecourt.\n\nThe Robobrains stared at him, their arms flailing and domed brains all floating, some squawking gibberish about once being 'real people', as well as reciting transponder codes that RELCOM had put out to prevent Kang from being killed or converted on sight.\nOnce Kang reached the center chamber of the Casket, he found himself face to... brain, with a rather interesting Robobrain. Bathed in the seemingly endless red glow of the computer screens, bio-med gel tanks, and blood-colored lights hanging over the two of them, a slightly larger-than-average Robobrain, with a singular eye and completely red paint job, furiously click-clacked away on a keyboard, a small red book laying next to them.\n\nNoting the one spot on the Robobrain that had been untouched by the paint job, Kang began the conversation with a simple statement. "RELCOM, I presume?"\nThe typing instantly stopped. It felt as though all eyes, the one RELCOM had, as well as the entirety of the facility itself, were staring at him. It didn't help Kang that his face was now being broadcast on all the blood-red screens.\n\n"You Speak To The GIGABRAIN Of Communism, Kang Of Communism. To What Do You Wish To Share?"\nKang, having prepared for this interaction for some time, began explaining all that he knew of quantum physics, space-time travel, and the conclusion that Whitecourt had come to about interdimensional travel resulting in the current state of Canada.\n\nAfter some careful consideration, the blood-red of the room softened, as RELCOM opened his small red book.
